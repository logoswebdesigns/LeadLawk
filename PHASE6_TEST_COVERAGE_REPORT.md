## Code Patterns Tested

### Clean Architecture Patterns
- Repository Pattern
- Use Case Pattern
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Cache-Aside Pattern
- Unit of Work Pattern
- Observer Pattern

### Testing Patterns Applied
- AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Test Doubles (Mocks, Stubs)
- Test Data Builders
- Integration Test Isolation
- Performance Benchmarking

## Coverage Analysis

### High Coverage Areas
- Core utilities and helpers
- Domain entities and models
- Event system
- Cache management
- API integration layer

### Areas Needing More Tests
- UI components (Flutter widgets)
- Complex provider interactions
- Error boundary scenarios
- Edge cases in business logic

## Test Failures Analysis

### Current Failures (36)
The failures appear to be related to:
1. Mock setup in some integration tests
2. Widget testing environment setup
3. Provider initialization in tests
4. Async timing issues in some tests

### Recommended Fixes
1. Update mock configurations for new API changes
2. Add proper widget test wrappers
3. Initialize providers correctly in test setup
4. Add proper async/await handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix the 36 failing tests
2. Add widget tests for new UI components
3. Increase coverage for providers
4. Add more edge case tests

### Phase 6.2 Preparation
With the test infrastructure in place, we're ready to move to:
- **Phase 6.2**: Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Phase 6.3**: Monitoring & Observability
