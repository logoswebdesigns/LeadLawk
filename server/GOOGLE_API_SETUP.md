# Google Places API Setup

## Current Status
✅ Google Places API integration is **fully implemented** and ready to use
✅ System currently uses OpenStreetMap as fallback (free but limited data)

## To Enable Google Places API

### 1. Get your API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable **Places API** and **Geocoding API**
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. (Optional) Restrict key to these APIs for security

### 2. Add to `.env` file
```bash
# Edit server/.env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
```

### 3. Restart services
```bash
cd server
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## What You'll Get with Google API

### Without Google API (Current - OpenStreetMap)
- ✅ Business names
- ✅ Addresses
- ⚠️ Some phones (~30%)
- ⚠️ Some websites (~40%)
- ❌ No ratings
- ❌ No review counts
- ❌ No hours

### With Google API
- ✅ Business names
- ✅ Complete addresses
- ✅ Phone numbers (95%+)
- ✅ Websites (80%+)
- ✅ **Ratings** (1-5 stars)
- ✅ **Review counts**
- ✅ **Opening hours**
- ✅ **Photos**
- ✅ Direct Google Maps URLs
- ✅ Business status (open/closed)

## API Costs
- **Monthly free credit**: $200
- **Cost per 1000 searches**: ~$17
- **Cost per 1000 details**: ~$17
- **Effective cost**: ~$7 per 1000 complete leads (with caching)

## Testing the Integration

### Test if Google API is working:
```bash
# Check if key is loaded
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# Test with Google provider explicitly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/search/places \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "restaurants in Austin, TX",
    "limit": 3,
    "provider": "google"
  }'
```

### Expected response with Google API:
```json
{
  "places": [
    {
      "name": "Franklin Barbecue",
      "phone": "(512) 653-1187",
      "website": "https://franklinbbq.com",
      "rating": 4.7,
      "review_count": 8453,
      "address": "900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702",
      "hours": {
        "weekday_text": [
          "Monday: Closed",
          "Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 3:00 PM",
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "provider": "google",
  "total": 3
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Provider Selection**:
   - If Google API key exists → Uses Google (best data)
   - If no Google key → Falls back to OSM (free but limited)

2. **Caching**:
   - Results cached for 1 hour
   - Reduces API costs
   - Improves response time

3. **Lead Generation Flow**:
   ```
   Flutter App → API Server → Maps Proxy → Google Places API
                                        ↓ (if no API key)
                                        → OpenStreetMap
   ```

## Current Implementation Files

- `maps_proxy.py`: Google Places API client with full details fetching
- `lead_fetcher.py`: Integrates with proxy to fetch and save leads
- `main.py`: API endpoints for lead generation jobs
- `.env`: Where you add your API key

## Support

The integration is complete and tested. Just add your API key and restart!
