# LeadLawk

A local lead generation and management system with Flutter UI controls for web scraping. Built with Clean Architecture, this app allows you to discover and manage business leads with customizable qualification thresholds.

## Features

- **UI-Controlled Scraping**: Configure and run scrapes directly from the Flutter app
- **Smart Qualification**: Set custom thresholds for rating, reviews, and recency
- **Lead Management**: Track lead status (New, Called, Interested, Converted, DNC)
- **Platform Detection**: Identifies website builders (GoDaddy, Google Business Sites)
- **Local Storage**: Everything runs locally with SQLite
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular, testable Flutter code with Riverpod state management

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Clean Architecture + Riverpod + Dio + GoRouter)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Scraping**: Scrapy (polite, HTML-only)
- **Database**: SQLite via SQLAlchemy
- **Platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon compatible)

## API Endpoints

### Scraping

- `POST /jobs/scrape` - Start a new scrape job
  ```json
  {
    "industry": "painter",
    "location": "Austin, TX",
    "limit": 50,
    "min_rating": 4.0,
    "min_reviews": 3,
    "recent_days": 365
  }
  ```

- `GET /jobs/{job_id}` - Check job status

### Lead Management

- `GET /leads` - List leads (supports filtering)
- `GET /leads/{id}` - Get lead details
- `PUT /leads/{id}` - Update lead status/notes

## Testing

### Flutter Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Python Tests

```bash
cd server
pytest test_server.py
```

## Development

### Code Generation (Flutter)

After modifying models:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Database Reset

To reset the database:

```bash
rm server/db/leadlawk.db
```

The database will be recreated on next server start.

## Configuration

### Scraper Settings

Default thresholds can be modified in the UI's Advanced Settings:
- Min Rating: 4.0 stars
- Min Reviews: 3 reviews  
- Recent Days: 365 days

### API Configuration

Server settings in `server/main.py`:
- Host: `0.0.0.0`
- Port: `8000`

## Troubleshooting

### Android Studio Not Recognizing Flutter Project

1. Close Android Studio
2. Open Android Studio
3. Select "Open" and choose the LeadLawk folder
4. Let it index the project
5. Run configurations should appear

### Server Connection Issues

Ensure the server is running and check:
- Firewall settings
- Port 8000 availability
- CORS configuration in `server/main.py`

### Database Lock Errors

SQLite can lock during concurrent access. Restart the server if this occurs.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real Google Maps scraping (currently using mock data)
- [ ] Export leads to CSV/Excel
- [ ] Email integration
- [ ] Call logging with duration tracking
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Multi-user support
