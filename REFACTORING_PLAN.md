   - Extract into 10+ focused widgets (<100 lines each)
   - Will establish patterns for other Flutter refactoring

2. **Critical Security (Phase 3.2)**: Implement authentication
   - Currently NO authentication on any endpoint
   - Major security vulnerability
   - Need JWT implementation urgently

3. **Continue Phase 2**: Domain Layer Refactoring
   - Fix presentation layer coupling
   - Implement Command Pattern for actions
   - Extract business logic from widgets

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- ❌ **No Authentication**: Any user can delete all data
- ❌ **God Objects**: 10+ files over 500 lines slowing development
- ❌ **Missing Tests**: ~70% of code untested

### Medium Risk Items
- 🚧 **Tight Coupling**: Presentation layer dependencies
- 🚧 **Performance**: No caching or query optimization
- 🚧 **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error responses

### Low Risk Items
- ✅ **SQL Injection**: Protected by ORM
- ✅ **New Code Quality**: Following standards

---

## Time Estimate

Based on current progress rate:
- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks (50% complete)
- **Phase 2-6**: 10 weeks
- **Total**: 12 weeks to achieve world-class standards

This plan ensures systematic improvement while maintaining functionality and building a maintainable, scalable codebase that meets 2025's highest engineering standards.
